        <p>Hello. My name is Matthew Berg. I am from Idaho Falls, Idaho. I am a husband and father of a 2 year old
            toddler
            and soon to be newborn. I love to spend time with my family and in my spare time, which is very little, I do
            things like video games,
            D&D and a wide variety of boardgames. I work a full time job and decicded that I should better myself and
            further my education with something that would effectively accent my Business Managment Marketing Degree.

        <p>I live in the beautiful state of Idaho, in the city of Idaho Falls. What this state lacks for major cities,
            massive population and insane amounts of shopping, it makes up for abundantly with beautiful scenery,
            wonderful
            weather, because I hate the heat, and so much more. It is the main stop along most routs to visite the
            national parks such as
            Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Glaicer National park. I absolutely love traveling around Idaho and visiting
            the many parks,
            hiking trails, and other outdoor activities.</p>
